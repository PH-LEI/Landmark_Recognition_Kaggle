# Landmark_Recognition_Kaggle

This project is my first atempt in Kaggle Challenges. 

I choosed Google Landmark Recognition Challenge because it's a great opportunity for me to practice data science skills on image data. I already have some experiences working on machine learning projects with numeric and text data, but I have never worked on images at that time. 

I see landmark recognition as an interesting topic because I planned to build an building recognition app for UW campuses to solve the problem that it's easy for me to get lost in campus trying to find the classroom.

I used different approaches in this project including IBM Watson, Azure and TensorFlow(on local machine) to build classifier.

The detail of this project is in Project_Report.pdf

For the TensorFlow (on local machine) expreiments: You can find the code and the experiment process/results in Pre-trained_Model_Implementation.html or Pre-trained_Model_Implementation.ipynb. I use jupyter notebook during the experiments to track the results.
